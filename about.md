Hi! 

My name is Víctor Fernández, and this is my blog to publish my latest updates about my project approved to be part of the Google Summer of Code 2018. At least, I will try to publish here once a week, to keep my followers wll informed.

You can check out the proposal on the [GSoC page](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5257820488859648/#5421604163551232).
