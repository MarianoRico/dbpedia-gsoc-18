On this sixth week of coding, I have focused on defining the overall architecture of the system. It has been resumed on the following image:

I have also spent some time to add new annotations to the system and evaluate the behavior with the same classifiers than the paper show.

Apart from this, I have been documenting the data preparation part, which is an essential task on every machine learning project. It has been the toughest part up to this moment. In the original paper, the description was naive, but in reality, it has not been so straightforward as someone could expect after reading the article mentioned above.
