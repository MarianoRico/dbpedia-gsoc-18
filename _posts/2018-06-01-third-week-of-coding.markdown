On this week, I have been focused mainly on two different tasks:

* Adding more examples of annotations to the dataset. Those examples will be used in the future to prove that the results are coherent and can be improved as more instances are added to the training dataset.

* In addition to annotating, I have also tried with the task of generating the metrics and statistics that Weka will evaluate on the classification step.

Appart from this two tasks, I also have been designing the architecture of the system: which modules will be used and how they'll be connected.
