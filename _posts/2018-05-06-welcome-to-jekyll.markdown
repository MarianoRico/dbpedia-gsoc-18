I have recently selected by DBpedia to participate on the 2018 edition of the Google Summer of Code. For the next three months I will be developing a [web application to detect incorrect mappings across DBpedias in different languages](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5257820488859648/#5421604163551232). This project intends to ensure that all mappings for every language are done in a consistent way.

DBpedia has assigned me Mariano Rico and Nandana Mihindukulasooriya as mentors for the project, and thew will follow my developing process very close. In this blog I will publish weekly all the updates and the progress done so far.

Check out this page regularly and don't miss anything from this exciting experience!
