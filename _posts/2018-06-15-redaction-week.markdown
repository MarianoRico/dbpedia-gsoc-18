title: Paper redaction week
date: '2018-06-15'

On this sixth week of coding, we (my mentors and I) have focused more on writing a paper than implementing the web application. To be more precise, we are extending the redaction of the original paper to include more results (as explained on the post of the past week) and also to include a detailed description of the system architecture that implements the proposed classifier solution.

This image shows up the system architecture that we will implement.

Apart from this, we are improving the explanation of the data preparation part, which is an essential task on every machine learning project. It has been the toughest part up to this moment. In the original paper, the description was naive, but in reality, it has not been so straightforward as someone could expect after reading the article mentioned above.

We have included different examples and explained the exact sources we used to generate the different datasets used and also how are calculated the features needed for the classifier input.

As soon as we publish the paper, I will try to link it from this blog to put it available for anyone interested in it.
