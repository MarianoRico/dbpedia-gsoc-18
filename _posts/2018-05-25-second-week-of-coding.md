On this second week I have done some progress on the next tasks:
* After a meeting with my two mentors, we have decided to design the architecture of the system and generate more training examples to test if we can obtain the same results with more instances.
* I have learned to generate the input dataset for Weka, used on the previous experiments through a Java project and a SPARQL endpoint
* To do the task aforementionated, it is needed to reconstruct (reify) a .ttl file from .tql file, and dump the triples to a triple store
