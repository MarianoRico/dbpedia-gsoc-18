This edition of Google Summer of Code 2018 is over today. It is required
to submit a document explaining all the work developed so far from
the beggining of the project.

As the document needs to be public, I will post the link here:
[vfrico/dbpedia-gsoc-18](https://github.com/vfrico/dbpedia-gsoc-18/blob/master/deliver-gsoc.md). This document contains all the information about the code developed and how to execute it. All the work is published under a free software license: Apache 2 License.

The web application can be accesed from this URL: [http://35.187.57.43:3000/](http://35.187.57.43:3000/)

It has been a very productive summer thanks to Google and DBpedia. It has been
a pleasure to work with DBpedia and my mentors, and if I had the opportunity again, I will apply again for GSoC, with no doubt.
